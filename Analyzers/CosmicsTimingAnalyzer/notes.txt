This is a module which will generate a plot of the resolution of the timing
as reconstructed in Ecal.  It takes cosmic superclusters that are contained
in one trigger tower and takes the average of all crystals above a threshold
in that tower/cluster to get a baseline time.  Then the difference in time
between all but 1 crystal and the average is plotted.  This distribution
(deltaTbetweenCrys or something like that) is the key resolution plot.
